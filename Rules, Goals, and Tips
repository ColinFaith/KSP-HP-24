Rules:

    1. Do negatively altering the composition or navigation of crafts places by other players without their permission. Adding to them is okay. Once you have added to it, consider attempting to get a unanimous vote before doing something like deorbiting.

    2. To the best of your ability, finish any objectives come due from the alarm clock, such as docking a rendezvous, or at least putting a lander into a stable orbit. Don't delete alarms without recreating them before you pass off the save.

    3. Do not add or remove mods not included in the safe list. Changes can be later decided by democratic discussion.

    4. Do not exceed one real-life week before uploading an updated save. If you wait too long, and someone else calls dibs on the last save, your changes will not be canon.

    5. Do not f12 cheat or save edit. Reverting is fine. Changing a kerbal name (after yourself?) is fine, but make sure you aren't doing something like creating a second Jeb.


Goals:


    1. Colonize: Get as many kerbals out there, through and up to the reaches, and setup to survive as long as possible.

    2. Logicsticize: Aid in creating a solar (or interstellar) infrastructure to support travel, kerbal sustainment, communication, and colony growth.

    3. Monetize: Whether with contracts or resources returned to Kerbin, stack the Kerbucks high.

    4. Aestheticize: Make those crafts sexy, make them horrifying, or at least give them a catchy name.

Tips: (add yours, but keep it relavent to the save, rather than general KSP tips)

    1. Leave some identifying mark on your crafts, be it just having your username on the ship, custom naming your pilot after your username, or having a custom flag (that's also uploaded). This will cut down on any potential confusions on who to contact if something needs to change.
