Kerbal Space Program 1 Hot Potato Repository for Year 2024

Welcome to the repository for the hot potato save file and ckan profiles

First, download the Kerbal Space Program folder and drag and drop it over your own game folder. Aside from the save files, there's also a flags folder that players may add custom flags to.

Next, pick either the BASIC or DELUXE ckan files and import them to ckan before loading the save.

BASIC is the agreed upon minimum mods for the hot potato.

DELUXE is a suite of my favorite QoL and graphics mods that should not have an effect between saves. Meaning switching between a save using BASIC, and one using DELUXE should have no more than superficial conversion errors - if any. Feel free to make suggestions for adding to the DELUXE profile. 

If you are going to add mods on top of one of these profiles, make sure you know what you are doing. Your mods cannot make any further mechanical effects on the save file. Mods like FAR shant be added. Mods like Diverse Kerbal Heads are fine to add, but don't anticipate the next time you play the same kerbals will have the same faces, if the player(s) between weren't using the same additional mods.

After that, play to your heart's content with the new save, but if you do not merge your save within 6 real life days, your changes will not be canon, and the previous save file will be available to the next player who wants it. As a matter of honor, allow as many other people a chance before you take another go. Give it at least another 6 days with no-one claiming it before you pick it up for another go. Similarly, if you merge, another player picks it up and merges after a few days, give a day or so for a third player to try before you pick it up again.

You are probably better off learning how to use GitHub yourself than from an amateur like me, but basically, branch the main, upload the KSP-HP-24-SAVE folder (Or copy my folder method if you want to add your own flag), create a pull request, merge the request, and then delete your branch.

And most importantly, make a comment that you are done with the save in the merge, and on the subreddit post https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1d1c28c/ksp_1_subreddit_2024_hotpotato/

See you out there.
